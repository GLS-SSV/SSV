# Space Shuttle Vessel
Space Shuttle Vessel (SSV) is an addon for Orbiter Space Flight Simulator (http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/). The purpose of this addon is to simulate NASAâ€™s Space Transportation System Program as much as possible. Currently only some elements have been completed and work on others is ongoing.

This release of SSV is for use in Orbiter 2016.


# Installation
1. Install Orbiter.

2. Install the required addons:

	OrbiterSound 4.0 or 5.0 (http://orbiter.dansteph.com/forum/index.php?page=download)

	Antelope Valley scenery pack (http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/mirrors/orbiter_radio/tex_mirror.html)

3. Extract the files into your Orbiter installation folder, overwriting any existing files.
WARNING: The SSV installation overwrites the default Base.cfg and Earth.cfg files.

4. Install the "SSV_Font_A" and "SSV_Font_B" fonts, located in the "<Orbiter installation>\Install\Space Shuttle Vessel" directory, by opening them and selecting "Install". After successful installation the files can be deleted.

5. The displays in SSV require the MFD resolution of 512 x 512 (Orbiter Launchpad > Extra > Instruments and panels > MFD parameter configuration > MFD texture size).

6. The local light sources have to be enabled for the external lights in SSV to work (Orbiter Launchpad > Visual effects > Local light sources, and additionally in D3D9 Orbiter Launchpad > Video > Advanced > Local lights).

NOTE: If you encounter the error "msvcp140.dll is missing" you need to download the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017.


## Optional addons
For a better visual experience, using the D3D9 graphics client (https://www.orbiter-forum.com/resources/d3d9-for-orbiter-2016.5493/) is strongly recommended, although not required (minimum version R4.25). If using the D3D9 graphics client, the "Disable near clip plane compatibility mode" option in the D3D9 Advanced Setup dialog (Orbiter Launchpad > Video > Advanced) should be checked.

For an accurate rendezvous profile simulation, it is recommended the installation of the excellent Shuttle FDO MFD (https://github.com/indy91/Shuttle-FDO-MFD) by indy91, which handles the ground based calculations required for rendezvous.
