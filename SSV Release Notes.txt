*** Release notes for SSV v1.3 ***
- The payload attachment IDs have updated and are now enforced, so an attachment with the ID "G" will no longer be attachable to the RMS, as it now requires exactly "GF". Attachment data is available in the Payloads section of the manual.



*** Release notes for SSV v1.2 ***
- Following a simplified convention, based on historical usage, the original "Thumb Wheel" Selector Wheels are only available in OV-102, OV-099 and OV-104, while the later "Push Wheel" Selector Wheels are only installed in OV-103 and OV-105
- The best view position for Panel R13U with the "Push Wheel" Selector Wheels installed is Left-lean from the Aft Pilot Station



*** Release notes for SSV v1.1 ***
- The new Vent Door system requires launch scenarios to be generated
- Rotary Switch Pontentiometer: this new switch type, currently in use in the HUD and MDU brightness switches, rotates clockwise with a left-click on the right-half or the switch, and rotates counterclockwise with a left-click on the left-half of the switch
- This version corrects swapped port and starboard PRLAs, so PRLAs of existing missions will now show in the opposite side, along with latch systems
