*** Release notes for SSV v1.1 ***
- The new Vent Door system requires launch scenarios to be generated
- Rotary Switch Pontentiometer: this new switch type, currently in use in the HUD and MDU brightness switches, rotates clockwise with a left-click on the right-half or the switch, and rotates counterclockwise with a left-click on the left-half of the switch
- This version corrects swapped port and starboard PRLAs, so PRLAs of existing missions will now show in the opposite side, along with latch systems
