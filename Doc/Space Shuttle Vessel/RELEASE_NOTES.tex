\textbf{Release notes for SSV v1.5}\\\\
$\rightarrow$ Previous versions had 1 as the value of the PMODE I-Load, which causes the guidance mode displayed in the HUD to be wrong during TAEM. To correct this in existing missions/scenarios, the value of PMODE should be 0 in mission files, 0 in scenarios prior to A/L interface, and "as is" in scenarios after A/L interface.\\
$\rightarrow$ A bug was discovered in the "Save current ..." function in Orbiter 2016, which causes a SSV scenario to be partially copied. For now, to save a "(Current state).scn" scenario, it is recommended to "manually" copy and/or rename the scenario. This issue is external to SSV, and will be corrected in future Orbiter versions.\\

The release notes of previous releases are available in the "<Orbiter installation>\textbackslash SSV Release Notes.txt" file.
