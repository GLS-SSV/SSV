 * @brief	Implementation of the Sensor class.
 *
 * This class simulates a sensor, receiving input data and lineraly converting it
 * to a value from MinVoltage to MaxVoltage, and then sending it thru a discrete
 * line. Minimum and maximum input values and output voltages are specified as
 * constructor arguments. The output is always limited from MinVoltage to MaxVoltage.
 * For obtain an inverse proportionality between input and output, swap the contructor
 * parameters MinValue and MaxValue.
